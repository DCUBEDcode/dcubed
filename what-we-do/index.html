        <h2>User experience</h2>
        <h3 class="link-to" id="app-design">App design</h3>
        <p>If you have your own development team and just need someone who can help you untangle your thoughts and
          visually bring them to life, we can also help with this. Fortunately, we speak the same language developers
          do, so we can make sure that we create achievable designs and work with your team to execute.</p>
        <p>We can deliver design assets in any format that suits you needs, PDF, Sketch files or via design platform
          tools like inVision.</p>
        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
        <p>A step further from the design stage, prototyping is often super important to help you learn what works and
          what doesn’t work with your product.</p>
        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <h3>Large scale websites</h3>
        <p>If your business needs a website that needs to do a little more heavy lifting than just a simple Wordpress
          site with a simple contact form and an image gallery then you’ve come to the right place. Our team has years
          of experience creating and maintaining robust websites that handle millions of requests a day.</p>
        <p>We specialise in creating websites that take advantage of more advanced features such as - multi-level
          account systems, email notifications, Stripe integration and payment gateways, file upload which take
          advantage of Amazon Web Services such as S3.</p>
        <h3>Web applications</h3>
        <p>Our team are big believers in the power of the web. We love the accessibility, the speed of development and
          we are constantly blown away every day by the things we see being built. Web applications are our bread and
          butter. Whether you have some legacy software that needs to be brought into todays digital landscape or you
          have business processes that you need to automate, that is right up our alley.</p>
        <p>Everyone knows the stats - mobile phone usage has long surpassed desktop usage on the web. This is why we
          believe it’s critical that the experience on mobile web apps must look and feel just as good as their native
          counterparts. Our approach is to nail the designs and user flows on smaller devices and only then start
          designing for larger screens. Mobile development is not an after thought for us.</p>
        <p>So if you need your own cloud based file storage system, maybe an internal staff training tool or even a
          self service food ordering app then get in touch and let’s make magic!</p>
